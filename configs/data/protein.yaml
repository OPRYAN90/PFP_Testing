# Task configuration - choose one: "mf", "bp", "cc"
task_type: "mf"        # Molecular Function (489 classes)
# task_type: "bp"      # Biological Process (1943 classes) 
# task_type: "cc"      # Cellular Component (320 classes)

# Batch size (recommended per task based on label space size)
# MF (489 classes): 4-6 batch size works well
# BP (1943 classes): 2-3 batch size (large label space needs more memory)  
# CC (320 classes): 6-8 batch size (smaller label space, can use larger batches)
batch_size: 4          # Default for MF task - adjust for other tasks

# Data loading parameters
num_workers: 4         # Number of subprocesses for data loading (adjust for your machine)
pin_memory: true       # Pin memory for faster GPU transfer
# Task-specific batch size recommendations (uncomment when switching tasks):
# For BP task: batch_size: 2
# For CC task: batch_size: 6

# max_sequence_length: 1024
